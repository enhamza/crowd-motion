* One room evacuation (corresponds to Figure 3. in the paper) with $f(x,y) = e^{-3\times\left((x-\frac{1}{2})^2 + (y-\frac{1}{2})^2\right)}$.

* One room evacuation (corresponds to Figure 4. in the paper) with $f(x,y) = 0.2 + \vert\cos(3x+5y)\vert$ and a source term located at $\Gamma_{S} = \lbrace 0\rbrace\times[0.3,0.6]$
